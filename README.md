# opendaylight-simple

Run a typical OpenDaylight SDN application such as netvirt without requiring the Apache Karaf OSGi runtime container.

Currently just a feasibility study to better evaluate required effort and gaps; may turn into more, later.

Something similar has, of course, already been done before, in the fdio/vbd projects

## How to use

_TBD_
